ðŸŽ¯ Our class was recently introduced to APIs and we've been tasked with building a simple app with an API

ðŸ§© View NASA's APOD either by selecting a date or clicking "Get random APOD"

ðŸŒ™ Check out the live site here: https://get-nasa-apod.netlify.app/

ðŸ¤– I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project

âœ¨ NASA's APOD API: https://github.com/nasa/apod-api
